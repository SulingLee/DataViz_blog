Data Preparation in Excel and Tableau\r\nMajor Observations\r\n1. Overall\r\n2. Top Importers\r\n3. Top Exporters\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\nThe data visualization for this makeover is created by using data provided by Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS). In this data visualization makeover, we are tasked to explore and revise the scatter plot with bubble points shown below.\r\n\r\n2. Evaluation of Original Visualisation\r\nWe start by exploring the original visualisation in terms of clarity and aesthetics.\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nTitle\r\nThe title for the visualization is missing, leaving the reader to interpret the message by themselves. The time period for the data set is not given, making it difficult to assess which year this visualization is for, as well as whether the values shown are aggregates of a few years or of one year.\r\nAxes\r\nNo units are provided for the axes. Imports are on the y-axis, but the label is placed along the side of the x-axis instead. Whereas Exports are on the x-axis, but its label is placed along the y-axis instead. The axes are for continuous variables and the scale is given but no tick marks are shown. Tick marks on the axes would make it easier for the reader to tell the values of the Exports and Imports by reading them off the axes.\r\nChart Type\r\nA scatter plot with large bubbles makes it difficult to compare the trade partners by Exports or Imports as the readers have to imagine where the centre points will be if they are projected onto the axes. A better method to visualize the rank would be to line the trade partners linearly for each measure.\r\nThe scatter plot background is divided into two triangles, with the upper one showing ‘Net Importer’ and the lower one showing ‘Net Exporter’. The Trade Partner is a ‘Net Importer’ when its centre point falls in the upper triangle and vice-versa for ‘Net Exporter’. However, the bubbles are large and floating above the diagonal boundary line, hiding it from view. For example,it is difficult to tell if the centre points for EU and Republic of Korea lies above or below the diagonal. It would be better if the bubbles were transparent so that the diagonal and centre points can be seen.\r\nSize and Order of the Bubbles\r\nThe size of bubble is explained in the note as the “total merchandise trade value with the trading partner”. However this explanation does not tell the reader if they should be comparing the bubbles based on the area or the radius. Also comparison of the size of the bubbles across the chart is not easy as small differences in size is not detectable. This makes it difficult to rank the countries based on the bubble size. The bubbles appear to overlap without any apparent order. For instance, United States with a larger bubble overlaps the smaller bubble of EU, but in another cluster, the smaller Thailand bubble overlaps the larger bubble of the Republic of Korea. Making the overlap more consistent will help the reader be able to compare the sizes of the bubbles more easily especially for clusters of bubbles of similar sizes like Japan and Republic of Korea. A suggests would be to sort the bubbles from smallest to largest, and overlap them accordingly with the largest bubble at the background. \r\nLabels\r\nThe label for each bubble identifies the Trade Partners clearly. However, the value on the label is not explained leaving the reader to wonder which trade indicator is shown. This makes it harder to understand the message of the visualization. Labels are not given a standard orientation with some labels covering the white centre points of neighbouring bubbles.\r\nAnnotation/ Source\r\nA note is given to explain the significance of the size of the bubble and the white centre point. This is helpful for the reader as this is an important note, perhaps the font size could be increased so make it more readable. An annotated insight is given at the bottom of the chart with an ‘i’ symbol to make it standout as important. However, this insight is not drawn from interpretation of the chart as they refer to two different years 2009 and 2006. The chart does not allow for comparison across years. A suggestion would be to create a filter to allow the user to select for the time period they want to view for comparison. The source is mentioned.\r\n2.2 Aesthetic\r\nSize of the Centre Point\r\nThe white centre point is fairly large in comparison with the shaded diagonal boundary. This make it difficult to tell if Japan is a net importer or exporter accurately as the entire point rests on the boundary. Reducing the size of the centre point will make it more precise but the trade-off would be less a less visible centre point.\r\nLabels\r\nLabels are unnecessarily large, hiding and covering important information such as the centre points. Smaller labels for Trade Partners could be used and additional information on the trade metrics be placed on a pop up box instead to minimize the clutter in the chart. A thin dotted line is used to attach the label to the bubble. However the colour contrast is not sufficient for the dark green United States line over the dark purple EU bubble to make out this easily. It would be better to increase the transparency of the bubbles or select more contrasting colour choices. A small icon with a star is placed in the chart with an accompanying legend explaining that it indicates top net exporter/ importer. The icon is easy to interpret with the out arrow indicating exports and in arrow indicating imports.\r\nColours and Shading\r\nColours used are consistent for each country and it helps to make each bubble stand out in the chart. However the colours for Thailand and EU are too similar and it would be better if all the trade partners be given a unique colour. Colour consistency is maintained for the axes, axes labels and shaded triangle regions. The triangles are of a lighter shade of the axis colour. This is a subtle emphasis of the connection between the axis and the shaded region and helps to nudge the reader to interpret the chart in this light.\r\nData Ink\r\nThis chart has a high data ink ratio.\r\n3. Proposed Design\r\n\r\nTitles\r\nA main title is given to set the context of the visualization. The original visualization compares the ranking of trade partners for Exports and Imports. In line with the original visualization, the main title will deliver this message and sub-titles will be added to provide further details about each charts for the user to explore the filters.\r\nChart Type\r\nTo compare between export and imports, a slope graph with a dual axis is used to show the rank of the trade partners in each axis. A slope graph gives a summarized view of the two measures, Exports and Imports, making comparison easier. Also each axis presents the ranks of the trade partner in a linear way to allow users to tell immediately which trade partner contributes more as a importer or exporter. Bar charts showing the percentage contribution of the trade partner for Exports and Imports will be created and added to the right and left of the slope graph. This allows users to interpret the significance of the ranking based on the contribution to total. For example, even a small difference in Exports can make a difference to the ranking, but by looking at the percentage contribution, the user will be able to tell that the rank difference is not significant. Users will have access to a number of filters to allow for exploration based on year of choice, region/ country section, number of top exporters/ importers. Filtering by year allows users to see if there are any trends. Filtering by region or country adds greater clarity to the visualization as there will not be any overlaps in the comparisons. Ie. Asia is a region and should not be compared against countries like Malaysia and Thailand that makes it up. As balance of trade is a key indicator of overall trade surplus or deficit for Singapore, this measure will also be included in the chart as the slope colour instead of another chart to keep the visualization clean and minimal.\r\nY-axis\r\nUse a synchronized dual axis to create a list of the trade partners in terms of their rankings for Exports and Imports. This is an advantage over the scatter diagram where it is difficult to compare over two axes. Using slope lines makes comparison of the rank clear. Using the ranks instead of actual Export/ Import values ensures that the trade partners and slope lines are evenly spaced out and their labels show clearly. This allows for easier comparison.\r\nFilters\r\nThe two main filters for Year and Region/ Country will be placed at the top of the chart to nudge users to use them first as these filters affect all the charts. On the right will be two filters for Exports and Imports for users to further explore these aspects of the visualization. Simple instructions will be provided to explain the filters.\r\nAnnotation/ Source\r\nSome annotation will be provided to give some suggestion for filter settings to help the user to get started. The source will be provided at the bottom of the chart.\r\nLegend\r\nA legend will be placed at the bottom of the chart to help users interpret the chart.\r\nChart Order and Sizing\r\nThe charts will have their tooltip, labels and filters synchronized so that it is intuitive for the users and easy to obtain the results from either chart. The charts will be sized and sorted such that each row represents a trade partner and results can be read across the rows. As there are many filters, the visualization will be kept simple so that each change will be obvious for easy comparison.\r\nColours and Shading\r\nInstead of a diagonal boundary, this design makes use of diverging red-blue colours of the lines to indicate net importer or exporter, with darker colour indicating a higher value. The different colours make identifying the net importer or exporters more obvious. Dedicated colours will be assigned to each field (Export, Imports, Balance of Trade) to make it user friendly and consistent. There will be no shading at the background to distract the user from the visualization.\r\nLabels and Tooltip pop-ups\r\nLabels will be used to mark out the trade partners, percentages and rankings directly as these are the key information that should be keep on display all the time so that users can quickly compare them. To prevent overcrowding, the labels will be small and simple. Tooltips that pop-up will be used to provide further details for users to explore.\r\n4. Data Preparation in Excel and Tableau\r\nDownload the file from Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS) under the sub-section of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market at the following link https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data\r\nOpen the file in Excel. In the downloaded file ‘outputFile.xlsx’, sheet‘T1’ contains ‘Imports’ and ‘T2’ contains ‘Exports’ and we will rename the tabs as such. As the study period should be between January 2011-December 2020, we will delete the years not included in this range and also remove all headers and footers from each sheet. Save the file.\r\nOpen Tableau. Import the Excel file into Tableau by selecting ‘Microsoft Excel’ under the ‘Connect’ panel.\r\nIn the ‘Data Source’ tab, drag ‘Exports’ to the workspace to view the contents.\r\nAs the table is too long, we will pivot the columns containing dates as headers. Select the first date column ‘2011 Jan’ and hold down shift-key, scroll to the last date column ‘2020 Dec’ and select it. All the dates column are now highlighted. Click on the black triangle in ‘2020 Dec’ and select ‘Pivot’.\r\nThe dates are all now in rows.\r\nClick on the name of each column to rename. We will rename the columns as follows:\r\nClick on the data type ‘Abc’ to change the data type. Date type for ‘Date’ is ‘Date’ and ‘Export’ is ‘Number(decimal)’.\r\nTo obtain only the Trade Partner name in each row, we click the black triangle in ‘Variables’ and select ‘Custom Split’.\r\nExtract the Trade Partner name using the following:\r\nExtract the units ‘Millions’ or ‘Thousands’ by applying ‘Custom Split’ again:\r\nAfter splitting, we will rename ‘Variables – Split 1’ as ‘Trade Partner’ and ‘Variables – Split 2’ as ‘Units’.\r\nExport this dataset to Excel. Go to tab ‘Sheet1’ in ‘Data’, select ‘Exports(outputFile’), then ‘Export Data to CSV’, ‘Exports’. The file is saved as ‘Exports (outputFile)_Exports.csv’.\r\nGo back to tab ‘Data Source’. Remove ‘Exports’ file.\r\nDrag ‘Imports’ sheet into the workspace and repeat steps 4 to 8 to pivot and rename column and data type. Save this file as “Exports (outputFile)_Imports.csv”.\r\nOpen both files in Excel to view. Observe that the trading partners with trade listed as ‘Million dollars’ are regions.\r\nTo indicate this, we will rename ‘Million’ in the ‘Variable Split 2’ column as ‘Region’ and ‘Thousand’ as ‘Country’ in Excel.\r\nConvert all the Import and Export values into millions by dividing the values in thousands by 1000.\r\nRelabel the following trade partner names to the more commonly used terms:\r\nUse Excel ‘Find and Replace’.\r\nSave both files into the same Excel spreadsheet as “Exports (outputFile).xlsx”.\r\nImport into Tableau as before.\r\nTo join the two worksheets together, drag ‘Exports (outputFile)_Exports.xlsx’ into the work space and click on the black triangle.\r\nSelect ‘Open’ and drag ‘Exports (outputFile)_Imports.xlsx’ beside it. Click on the join icon and select ‘Full Outer’ as we want to keep the entries from both datasets.\r\nIn the pull down, we will match the fields for the joins, matching ‘Trade Partner’, ‘Date’ and ‘Group’. \r\nDelete the duplicated columns. Note that Singapore has more importing trade partners than exporting so there are some null values for exports. The final cleaned dataset:\r\n## Create the Slope Graph\r\nGo to worksheet ‘Sheet 1’, create a new variable ‘Balance of Trade’ to show the difference between the trade partners Export and Import value. In ‘Analysis’, select ‘Create Calculated Field’ and enter the following:\r\nNext, create two new fields to calculate the rank of the Trade Partners. In ‘Analysis’ select ‘Create Calculated Field’.\r\nEnter the following:\r\nDrag ‘Measure Names’ to ‘Columns’ and ‘Measure Values’ to ‘Rows’.\r\nIn ‘Marks’ change the chart display to ‘Line’.\r\nDrag ‘Trade Partner’ to ‘Detail’ in ‘Marks’ panel.\r\nIn ‘Measure Values’ remove ‘CNT(Exports(outputFile).csv)’ , ‘SUM(Exports)’, ‘SUM(Imports)’ and ‘SUM(Balance of Trade)’ as they are not useful for our chart.\r\nFor each of the remaining three ranked measures in ‘Measure Values’, right-click on each and select ‘Compute Using’ then ‘Trade Partner’.\r\nRight-click on the y-axis ‘Value’ and select ‘Edit axis’.\r\nCheck ‘Reversed’ as we want to display Trade Partners from the top.\r\nImprove the aesthetics of the visualisation. Click on ‘Size’ in the ‘Marks’ panel and select the thinnest width for the lines.\r\nDrag ‘Measure Value’ and ‘Trade Partner’ to ‘Label’ and click on it. Check ‘Show mark labels’ and ‘Line Ends’.\r\nNext, click on ‘Text’ and use the ‘Insert’ drop-down to format the label. Use a different colour for the rank.\r\nRight-click on ‘Export- Rank’ in the ‘Measure Values’ panel, select ‘Format’.\r\nIn the ‘Pane’ panel, select ‘Numbers’ and select ‘Number (Standard)’.\r\nRepeat for ‘Import-Rank’ and ‘Balance of Trade- Rank’ to change the displayed rank into an integer.\r\nAs there are currently too many Trade Partners displayed, the visualisation is too cluttered for meaningful exploration. Reduce the number of Trade Partners by creating a filter for users to select the Trade Partners they want to view. Drag ‘Export- Rank’, ‘Import- Rank’ and ‘Balance of Trade – Rank’ to ‘Filters’. In Filter dialogue box, select ‘At most’ so that a slider which is fixed at the start end will be created.\r\nTo view the filter, right-click on ‘Export- Rank’ in the ‘Filters’ panel and select ‘Show Filter’.\r\nThe filter will appear on the right of the chart.\r\nClick on the small black arrow on ‘AGG(Export – Rank)’ and select ‘Edit Title’.\r\nChange the title as follows:\r\nRepeat the steps to create similar filter for ‘Import-Rank’.\r\nFor ‘Balance of Trade – Rank’, select ‘Range of Value’ option for the filter so that users can explore trade partners with negative trade balance.\r\nCreate a filter for Year. Drag ‘Date’ into ‘Filters’. Select all the years and select ‘Show Filter’ to display it.\r\nFormat the year filter by clicking on the black triangle and select ‘Single Value (slider)’.\r\nSelect ‘Edit Title’ to change the displayed title as follows:\r\nDrag ‘Balance of Trade’ to ‘Colour’ in the ‘Marks’ panel and click on it.\r\nSelect ‘Edit Colors’ and by using red to denote negative Balance of Trade and blue to denote positive Balance of Trade, center the diverging colour palette at 0.\r\nRemove grid lines from the graph so that it will not distract users from the Slope graph.\r\nIn ‘Format’, select ‘Lines’. Under the ‘Rows’ tab, select ‘None’ for ‘Grid Lines’.\r\nRemove the y-axis by clicking on ‘Value’ and uncheck ‘Show Header’.\r\nRight-click on the header along the x-axis, select ‘Edit Alias’.\r\nRename the header in the pop-up dialogue box.\r\nRepeat for Import and Balance of Trade.\r\nDrag ‘Export- Rank’ , ‘Import-Rank’ and ‘Balance of Trade- Rank’ to ‘Tooltip’ in the ‘Marks’ panel. Click on ‘Tooltip’ and use different colours for each measure.\r\nDouble-click on the title ‘Sheet 1’ and give the chart a title.\r\nCreate a new sheet to show the proportion of trade each trade partner contributes to the total.\r\nClick on the icon to create a new sheet.\r\nDrag ‘Trade Partner’ to ‘Columns’ and ‘Export’ to ‘Rows’. Right click on ‘Export’ and select ‘Quick Table Calculations’ and ‘Percent of Total’.\r\nRight click on ‘Export’ again and select ‘Compute Using’ then ‘Trade Partner’.\r\nRight click on ‘Export’ again and select ‘Format’. In the ‘Pane’ tab, under ‘Numbers’, select ‘Percentage’ and format as follows:\r\nDouble click on ‘SUM(Export)’ in ‘Rows’ the formula will appear.\r\nCopy it and paste it in a new ‘Create Calculated Field’ dialogue.\r\nRight-click on ‘Trade Partner’ and select ‘Sort’.\r\nIn the pop-up sort by ‘Field’ and ‘Exports’ in Descending order.\r\nThis is the current view:\r\nClick on the icon to swap the orientation of the barchart.\r\nNext, we want to create a filter that will apply to all worksheets to filter based on the rank of Exports. (Currently the filters for Exports/ Imports and Balance of Trade do not have the ‘Apply to worksheets’ options in the pull down.) Right-click anywhere in the ‘Data’ panel and select ‘Create Parameter’.\r\nFrom the previous worksheet, we know that there are 88 Exporter to filter, hence we will set the range of the new parameter to be up to 88 as follows:\r\nIn ‘Analysis’, select ‘Create Calculated Field’ and create a new field that will give values less than the parameter value selected.\r\nDrag this new field to ‘Filters’ and set it to be always ‘True’.\r\nIn the ‘Parameters’ panel, right-click on ‘Exports Range’ and select ‘Show Parameter’.\r\nA filter will pop up allow for the visualisation to be filtered by the Export ranks across all worksheets.\r\nRepeat the steps 34 to 37 to create a similar filter for Imports in a new sheet.\r\nNavigate back to the worksheet with the filtered barchart. Drag the following filters into the ‘Filters’ panel. The settings are the same as previous (‘All’ for Group, Trade Partner and Year(Date)).\r\nTo format the appearance of the barchart in the ‘Marks’ panel, we will drag ‘Export Percentage of Total’ to ‘Color’. Drag ‘Trade Partner’ and ‘Export Percentage of Total’ to ‘Label’. Right-click on ‘Export Percentage of Total’ and select ‘Format’.\r\nIn the ‘Pane’ tab, format the number as follows:\r\nDrag ‘Trade Partner’, ‘Export-Rank’, ‘Import-Rank’ and ‘Balance of Trade – Rank’ to ‘Tooltip’. We will format ‘Tooltip’ the same as for the previous worksheet for consistency.\r\nRepeat step 40 to format the worksheet for the Imports bar chart.\r\nNavigate back to the Exports bar chart, right-click on the x-axis and select ‘Edit Axis’.\r\nUnder ‘Scale’ select Reversed’.\r\nThe chart will look like this:\r\nBefore creating the final visualisation in dashboard, synchronise all the filters by clicking on the black triangle of each and select ‘Apply to worksheet’, then ‘All using this Data Source’.\r\nGoing to the Slope Graph in ‘Sheet 1’, we will remove the earlier filters for ‘Export-Rank’, ‘Import-Rank’ and ‘Balance of Trade- Rank’ and add ‘Imports Filter – True’ and ‘Exports Filter – True’ to the ‘Filters’ panel.\r\nCreate a new dashboard and drag ‘Horizontal’ from ‘Objects’ to fill the whole space.\r\nDrag our first worksheet ‘Sheet 1’ into the space and add the bar chart for Exports to the left and the bar chart for Imports to the left of it.\r\nHide all titles and headers by right-clicking on them and selecting ‘Hide..’.\r\nMake it easier for the user we will adjust the heights of the three charts to match up row wise so that it is easier to read. Click on each worksheets and select ‘Fit Height’.\r\nMake some small tweak by adjusting the spacing so that the visualisation lies ups. Change the colours of the bar charts to differentiate between Exports and Imports, selecting the same colour as the Tooltip display for consistency. A quick way to do this is to click on the colour in ‘Tooltip’ and save it as a custom colour so that it wall appear in the palette for ‘Color’.\r\nAdd in the titles for each graph as will as a main title by dragging ‘Text’ into the dashboard space.\r\nAdd some suggestions for exploring the data as well as the source using ‘Text’.\r\nThe complete visualization:\r\nMajor Observations\r\n1. Overall\r\nAsia is the top Exporting and Importing region for Singapore, accounting for over 60% of trade. Asia’s impact on trade is even more significant when considering that America, Singapore’s second trading region for Exports is less than 10% and Europe, Singapore’s second trading region for Imports is about 15%. As an open economy, Singapore is highly depending on its Asian neighbours for trade. \r\nBy changing the filter to show ‘Country’ we can see the ranks of individual countries in terms of Exports and Imports. The very long tail for both Exports and Imports indicates that although Singapore trades widely with many trade partners, trade is only significant with a few countries.\r\n2. Top Importers\r\nIn 2020, an average of 62% of all products imported by Singapore are from Asia.\r\nThis is unsurprising as 8 out of the top 15 countries ranked by Imports in 2020 are from Asia. In 2020, the top 15 importing countries by import value are : Mainland China (14.7%), Malaysia (12.9%), Taiwan (11.3%), United States (10.9%), Japan (5.6%), South Korea (4.8%), Indonesia (4.3%), France (3.2%), Thailand (3.0%), Germany (2.7%), United Kingdom (2.5%), Philippines (2.1%) , UAE (1.9%) and Switzerland (1.8%).  Based on the Slope Graphs, we see that the top few countries do not have very steep slopes, indicating that the group of top Exporters and Importers are the same. Among the top 5 importers, we see that Mainland China has overtaken Malaysia as the top importing country since 2013. The slope lines are steeper for countries ranked further down the list, indicating a bigger difference in the ranks of Exports and Imports. These countries are mostly from Europe and the red lines indicates that Singapore has a trade deficit with them for 2020. Of note is also Taiwan with the darkest red line, this indicates that Taiwan is the top net importer with the largest Balance of Trade deficit. By filtering by other years, we see that 2020 was an unusual year for trade with the United States. It was the first year where there was a trade surplus with the United States (slope line changed from red to blue). This could be due to the fall in Imports coupled by a rise in Exports from 2019 to 2020.\r\nWe also see that the top importing countries have remained consistent over the years (2011 to 2020). There are two dominant groups, oil producing countries like the Gulf States and Venezuela, and electronic parts manufacturing countries like Mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.\r\n3. Top Exporters\r\nAsia buys on average, around 36% of all exports from Singapore from 2011 to 2020.\r\nThe top 5 exporting countries buys over 50% of all exports in 2020 and they are Mainland China (13.3%), Hong Kong SARc (12.2%), Malaysia (11.7%) Indonesia (9.0%) and the United States (7.0%). Of these, Hong Kong SARc has the darkest blue line indicating that it is the top net exporter. Filtering for other years, we see that Hong Kong has consistently been one of the top 3 Exporters, with a very steep slope line indicating a large drop of about 20 positions between its Exports rank and Imports rank.\r\nFiltering by years, we see that Mainland China has overtaken Malaysia as the top Exporting country since 2014 where the different in their percentage of total exports was less than 1%. However, by 2020, Malaysia has fallen to 4th position for Exports and with a 5% difference in total exports with Mainland China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Introduction\r\nInternational merchandise trade statistics are indicative of Singapore’s competitiveness in the global economic system. Our top trading countries, as consumers and producers, are important partners for economic growth and stability.\r\nIn this data visualization makeover, we are tasked to explore and revise the stacked area chart created by data from the Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS), for merchandise trade shown below.\r\nSource\r\n2. Evaluation of Original Visualisation\r\nWe start by exploring the original visualisation in terms of clarity and aesthetics.\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nThe title of the graph is inaccurate and vague. Firstly, the title does not indicate if these countries are top six in terms of Exports or Imports. Next, closer inspection of the dataset reveals that these countries are not top in terms of Exports or Imports.\r\nExports\r\nImports\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two y-axes provided for each sub-plot and each y-axis is scaled differently for Exports and Imports, making it difficult to compare the country’s Exports and Imports. The y-axes are also scaled differently across the sub-plots, making comparisons between countries difficult.\r\nThe x-axes are not scaled proportionally for comparison. In particular, Japan has only one year’s of trade statistics displayed. The other countries has two year’s data but the different lengths of the x-axis makes Mainland China and Malaysia appear longer than the rest.\r\nThe label of the x-axes indicate months but only the years are shown. This makes it difficult to tell if there are missing dates in data that are causing the x-axis to be shorter for some countries.\r\nThe sub-graphs do not appear as if they are ordered in any meaningful way. Countries could be ordered from first to last to better reflect the title.\r\n2.2 Aesthetic\r\nThere is poor use of stacked area chart and colours. As there are many overlapping regions and they are coloured differently, it appears as if there are three measures for each sub-graph.\r\nThe sub-title of each sub-graph is not aligned to the center of each sub-graph.\r\nNo tick marks are used on the y-axes even though they are of a continuous numerical scale.\r\nThe x-axis is labeled at the start of each year instead of the middle even though it is for a categorical scale. This results in the graph appearing as if it spans from mid-2019 to mid-2021.\r\nThe title is of a smaller font size than the names of countries when it should be the emphasis for this visualization.\r\n3. Proposed Representation\r\nThe proposed design is as follows. \r\n3.1 Clarity\r\nThe title and subtitle sets the context of the visualization. Since this is about trade, major events that have affected trade will be mentioned here to set the context for understanding the visualization. As the countries are not the top 6, we will just name them as the top countries.\r\nThe main panel shows a quick summary for easy comparison between countries across the two years. The right panel presents a detailed look into the trends which would be otherwise lost in the summarized view. To make the appearance less cluttered we will make use of the pop-up boxes to display the values of points of interest.\r\nX-axis showing both dates and countries allow for easy comparison across both dimensions.\r\nY-axis shows the relative value of Exports and Imports with their difference being the Balance of Trade. This allows readers to quickly assess which countries have contributed more in terms of overall trade balance.\r\nChoice of a Gantt bar chart shows the relationship between the variables in a simple summary. The detailed time series will show the impact of major events on trade and their trends for a more in-depth understanding of each country.\r\n3.2 Aesthetic\r\nColours are used to differentiate between Exports and Imports and brings attention to growth trends. Red and dark colours are used sparingly to focus the readers on key insights.\r\nA gradient colour for Balance of Trade allow for quick interpretation of positive or negative values.\r\nScaling the time series graph to be smaller than the main summary lends more emphasis to the summary.\r\nCoordinate the colours in both charts so that it is more intuitive to understand and easier to interpret the relationships between them.\r\nReference lines are used judicially to direct attention to what is important for comparison.\r\n4. Step-by-Step Guide\r\nData Cleaning\r\nOpen the data file in Excel. Extract only the relevant countries (Mainland China, Malaysia, United States, Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong) for the period from 2019 Jan to 2020 Dec from both the Import and Export sheets. There are no missing values in the table. Save and close the Excel spreadsheet.\r\nIn Tableau, create a new workbook and click ‘Connect to Data’. Choose ‘file type’ then ‘file name’ and select our Excel spreadsheet ‘viz1_clean.xlsx’. In the ‘Data Source’ tab, drag the table that we want (extracted Imports) into the workspace. \r\nOpen tab ‘Sheet 1’ and use Tableau to pivot the table, with ‘Measure Values’ in columns and ‘Variables’ in ‘Rows’.  Remove ‘CNT’ from ‘Measure Values’ by right-click and selecting ‘remove’. \r\nView the pivoted table by ‘Analysis’ > ‘View Data’.\r\nExport the data and save the file as “Import.csv”.\r\nRepeat steps 1 – 5 for Exports. Open the csv files in Excel, add a new column ‘Source’ to indicate if the data is for ‘Export’ or ‘Import’. \r\nReference lines are useful for the reader to do comparisons between the charts quickly in our trellis plot. We will find the value of average Import and Export values in Excel instead of Tableau as it is a fixed value and not a field. \r\nImport the cleaned dataset into Tableau.\r\nCreate a Gantt Bar plot showing Export, Import and Balance of Trade by year\r\nThe datatype for ‘Date’ is incorrect. Change by clicking on the icon and selecting ‘date’. \r\nBalance of trade is the difference between the value of a country’s exports and imports and is useful for assessing how Singapore’s trade partners contributes to our country’s balance of payments. Create a new variable to show the balance of trade. In tab ‘Sheet 1’, from ‘Analysis’ > ‘Create Calculated Field’.\r\nAdd ‘Date’ to ‘Columns’. Right-click on ‘YEAR(Date)’ pill to change it to ‘MONTH(Date)’. \r\nDrag ‘Measure Values’ to ‘Rows’. In the ‘Measure Values’ panel, remove ‘CNT’ and SUM(Balance) by right-clicking and select ‘Remove’. The line graph is automatically selected.\r\nDrag ‘Measure Names’ to ‘Color’ in the ‘Marks’ panel so that the line graphs for Export and Import are coloured differently.\r\nClick on ‘color’ to customise the appearance of the line graph. \r\nDrag ‘Import’ to the front of ‘Measure Values’ in ‘Rows’. \r\nIn the ‘Marks’ panel, click on ‘SUM(Import)’. Change the plot type to ‘Gantt Bar’. Drag ‘Balance’ to ‘Color’ and also to ‘Size’.\r\nAs ‘Balance’ should reflect if the balance of trade for that period if positive or negative, we will customise the colour as follows: Click on ‘Color’ > ‘Edit Colors’. \r\nClick on ‘Advanced’ and center the colour scale at 0 to reflect when there is positive or negative balance of trade. In the Gantt plot, red represents the period when Import exceeds Export, and blue when Export exceeds Import. \r\nWe will merge the two plots by clicking on ‘Measure Values’ in ‘Rows’ and selecting ‘Dual Axis’. Next, we will click on the y-axis on the right of the plot and select ‘Synchronize Axis’.\r\nAdd the reference line to show average Export and average Import. Right-click y-axis and select ‘Add Reference Line’. In the field ‘Value’, select ‘SUM(Import)’.\r\nSelect a dashed line to differentiate it from the line graph and select the same colour as Import.\r\nDrag ‘SUM(Export)’ to ‘Detail’ in the Marks panel for ‘SUM(Import)’. Right-click y-axis and select ‘Add Reference Line’. Set the parameters as follows:\r\nSelect a dashed line and match the colour to the line graph for Export. Repeat to obtain a reference line for Balance of Trade.\r\nFormat reference lines. Right click on ‘Average Exports’, select ‘Format’. In the pop-up panel, set as follows:\r\nAs the values from our source data are in thousand dollars, we will include ‘$’ prefix and ‘K’ suffix. Repeat for ‘Average Imports’ and ‘Average BOT’.\r\nFormat ‘Export’, ‘Import’ and ‘Balance’ similarly. For ‘Measure Values’ in the ‘Marks’ panel, right click on ‘SUM(Export)’. Select ‘Format’.\r\nIn the pop-up panel, select the ‘Pane’ tab. Set the values as currency as follows:\r\nSave and duplicate this as ‘Sheet 1(2)’. We will use ‘Sheet 1(2)’ to create a time series for each country.\r\nDrag ‘Country’ to ‘Columns’.\r\nClick on the y-axis ‘Import(Thousand Dollars)’ to sort in descending order.\r\nEdit ‘Tooltip’ for ‘SUM(Import)’ in Marks panel. Click on ‘tooltip’ and remove irrelevant fields. Append “$” and “K” to indicate that values are in thousands.\r\nTo improve the aesthetic, ‘SUM(Import)’ in ‘Marks’ pane, click ‘Size’ and increase the width of the bars.\r\nClick ‘Color’ and reduce the opacity of the bars.\r\nRemove header by right-click ‘Year of Date/ Country’, select ‘Hide Field Labels for Columns’.\r\nAdd a proper title. Click on the title and in the ‘Edit Title’ pop-up box, add a title and format it.\r\nRight-click on the x-axis, select ‘Format’. Make country names more visible by increasing the font size. In the ‘Columns’ tab, add vertical grid lines so that it will be easier to tell the countries apart. Match the appearance of the horizontal grid lines so that they will not detract from the plots.\r\nRename legend for ‘SUM(Balance)’ to ‘Balance of Trade’ using ‘Edit Title’.\r\nRename legend for ‘Measure Names’ to ‘Merchandise Trade’.\r\nTo show the percentage growth for Exports from 2019 to 2020. Drag ‘Export’ pill to ‘Rows’.\r\nClick on ‘Export’, ‘Quick Table Calculation’ then ‘Percent Difference’.\r\nClick on ‘Export’ again, select ‘Compute Using’ then ‘Date’.\r\nDouble-click on ‘Export’ pill and copy the formula.\r\nClick ‘Analysis’, ‘Create Calculated Field’. Paste the formula.\r\nApply a colour mask to show the difference between positive Export Growth and negative Export Growth for each country. Click ‘Analysis’, ‘Create Calculated Field’.\r\nRepeat to create another field for ‘Negative Export Growth’:\r\nRemove ‘SUM(Export)’ from ‘Rows’. The graph should look as before. In ‘Measure Values’ in the ‘Marks’ panel, drag both ‘Positive Export Growth’ and ‘Negative Export Growth’ to ‘Tooltips’. Add new formula for Export Growth and modify fields with changing colour.\r\nIn the ‘Marks’ panel, right-click on ‘Positive Export Growth’ and select ‘Format’. Change the format for ‘Numbers’ to reflect percentage as follows:\r\nRepeats steps to change ‘Negative Export Growth’ to percentage as well. Next, we will repeat Steps 33 and 34 for Import Growth.\r\nFormat ‘Tooltip’ in ‘Measure Values’ using the same colour for Export fields and the same colour for Import Fields to make the visual association stronger.\r\nRight-click on the main graph area and select ‘Annotate’ then ‘Area’. Type insights and observations in the text area. Arrange, resize, or format the resulting text box if required.\r\nCite the data source in ‘Caption’. Click on ‘Caption’ and in ‘Edit Caption’ pop-up enter the following:\r\nCompleted worksheet:\r\nCreate Timeseries for each country\r\nThe Gantt bar is a clean and simple visual to quickly summarise and compare trade of each country over the two years. However, the impact of global events on trade can be better understood by their time series. Hence we will create a small panel to show the time series of each country.\r\nWe pick up our makeover from the duplicated worksheet ‘Sheet 1(2)’ created in Step 22. Drag ‘Country’ to ‘Rows’.\r\nVertical reference lines are useful for comparing across all the countries. We create them by first converting ‘MONTH(Date)’ in ‘Columns’ to ‘continuous’.\r\nTo create vertical reference lines for the years, right-click on the y-axis and select ‘Add Reference Line’. Set the pop-up as follows to create a line that represents the start of 2019: Choose ‘Per Pane’ as it will be distracting if the label is duplicated for each country. To format the line, we choose a dash type in grey to differentiate from the solid line used in the line graphs.\r\nFor ‘Reference Line Label’ we fix the year to the top of the chart using the customised alignment:\r\nRepeat the steps to create another reference line at the start of 2020.\r\nCreate a reference line for COVID-19. From the time series, we observe that there are significant differences in trade around the start of 2020. The dips in the pattern of Exports and Imports are most obvious for China, United States and Malaysia. As these were also the countries deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we will insert a vertical reference line so that COVID-19 impact on trade is more obvious in the visualisation.\r\nThere were many significant events related to COVID-19 and trade globally. Since WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, we will use this date to mark the period of global emergency. Right-click on the y-axis and select ‘Add Reference Line’. As shown before we will set the following for the reference line:\r\nSelect a red dashed line.\r\nRight-click on ‘COVID-19’. Select ‘Format’ and match the colour of the label to the reference line.\r\nAlign the label to the centre of the graph to make it standout from the other reference lines.\r\nRemove the dates on the y-axis as the reference line provides sufficient context. Right click on the y-axis and de-select ‘Show Header’.\r\nCreate a title and explanations. Click on title to type and format a title to explain the graph.\r\nCompleted worksheet:\r\nCreate a dashboard\r\nWe use a dashboard to put two or more worksheets in the same visual. Click on the add Dashboard icon at the bottom.\r\nFor the ‘Dashboard’ tab on the left panel, drag the required worksheets to the workspace.\r\nPut the focus on the trade performance measure of the top countries by making it larger. Move the legends to the bottom of the graph. To show the link between graphs, standardize the colour for the same variable. In this case, we choose the colours used in the COVID-19 worksheet as the trend lines for Export and Imports are emphasized with the darker colours. Keep only one set of legend once the variables are coloured similarly.\r\nTry out different font sizes, colours and scales for the worksheets, formatting as required to put focus on the visualization that leads to the insights.\r\nPad the worksheets with blank whitespace around each chart to add emphasis. Drag ‘Blank’ from the ‘Objects’ panel to the gap between the two worksheets.\r\nAdd a title. Drag ‘Text’ from the ‘Objects’ panel to the top of the dashboard. Double-click to add a title.\r\nThe completed Dashboard:\r\n5.Derived Insights\r\nA comparison between 2019 and 2020 shows that average Exports rose by 2.0% and average Imports fell by 2.8%. Although the rise in Exports was not significant, average Balance of Trade increased 64% in the same period. The large percentage rise is mainly due to the small 2018 Balance of Trade value and fall in Imports, rather than a rise in Exports. Hong Kong is the top net exporter, contributing the bulk of the positive Balance of Trade. Taiwan and the United States are significant net Importers, with Taiwan at the top. Singapore’s top trading countries are also major economic powers. The Global Economic slowdown, rise in trade protectionism and the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to overall weaker trade environment globally in 2019 to 2020 and consequently Singapore’s trade is likewise affected.TodayOnline\r\nThe ranking of the top countries by Exports did not change from 2019 to 2020. Export growth to China, Japan and Hong Kong rose modestly below ~6% while Export growth to the United States and Taiwan rose significantly by more than ~12%. Malaysia was the only country where Export growth fell by a substantial ~18% from 2019 to 2020. The United States fell from 2nd to 4th in ranking for Imports. This resulted in the United States turning from net Importer to net Exporter from March 2020, registering a small positive Balance of Trade. Import growth were negative for China, Malaysia, United States and Japan, with the United States showing the most significant ~19% dip. This is perhaps due to the fall in consumption globally due to COVID-19 restrictions.Ministry of Trade & Industry\r\nOnce separated into individual timelines, trade differences between countries becomes more pronounced. While Exports fell, Imports to Malaysia rose only slightly at ~1% and this contributed to a negative balance of trade. Singapore is highly dependent on Malaysia for essential food supplies and demand rose during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic due to stockpiling. On the other hand, Malaysia entered a lockdown in March 2020 due to the pandemic and the economy has yet to recover. Exports to Malaysia in 2020 remains flat and below 2019 levels. Exports to the United States shows fluctuations and this could be due to the changing demand for goods as the COVID-19 pandemic takes root in the country. China is Singapore’s top Exporter and Importer. As a major economic power, China’s Imports and Exports had dipped sharply in February 2020 when it entered a lockdown following the outbreak of COVID-19. Trade with China has since recovered in tandem with its economic recovery. Hong Kong and Taiwan trade registered the same growth trend throughout 2019 to 2020, with Taiwan growing faster. They were also least affected by COVID-19 and had kept infected low in their population. With a small and open economy that is highly dependent on trade, has since Singapore directed efforts into diversifying trade so that it is more resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain and levering on the demand of countries less affected by COVID-19 through trade pacts and partnerships.ChannelNewsAsiaStraitsTimes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
